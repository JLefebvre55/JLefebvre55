# Design Brief

## The Opportunity

> A design brief outlining design brief outline. A meta-design brief if you will.

## Design Requirements

> What specific functions **must** candidate designs have in order to address the problem as it stands?

1. Must outline a design brief in structure and form **alone**.

## Stakeholders

> Whose wants or needs are we considering in the formulation of candidate designs?

1. Design brief writers (i.e. engineers, Jayden Lefebvre)
2. Repository visitors

## Objectives

> What do our stakeholders **value** in a solution, alongside/about necessary functions? What should be valued in a candidate design?

### High-Level

1. Usability (S1)
2. Prettiness (S2)

### Low-Level

1. Completeness (HL1)
2. Succinctness (HL1)
3. Formatted nicely (i.e. in Markdown) (HL2)

## Metrics

> How do we measure the degree to which our objectives are being achieved? How do we compare candidate designs?

1. Coverage of the scope of Framing (LL1)
2. Length (LL2)
3. Usage of design techniques, i.e. nested headers, bolding, italics (LL2)

## Criteria and Constraints

> What are the **mandatory optima** (constraints) and **suggested criteria** for design?

1. `Must` contain all of the headers for (M1):
    - The Opportunity;
    - Design Requirements;
    - Stakeholders;
    - Objectives, with subheaders for both High-Level and Low-Level;
    - Metrics;
    - Criteria and Constraints;
2. If it contains extraneous information, it `must` improve the usability and/or prettiness of the design brief outline (M2). For example, the following headers are optional, but help:
    - Lead Engineer or Contributors
    - Reference Designs, optionally with images
3. `Must` not exceed 100 lines of text (M2)
4. `Should` use bolding, italics, etc. *sparingly* to highlight important information (M3)
